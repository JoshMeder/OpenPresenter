<lines>
Shout to the Lord, all the earth,<br/>Let us sing<br/>Power and majesty, praise to the King;<br/>Mountains bow down and the seas will roar<br/>At the sound of Your name.<br/>I sing for joy at the work of Your hands,<br/>Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand,<br/>Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.

My Jesus, My Savior,<br/>Lord, there is none like You;<br/>All of my days<br/>I want to praise<br/>The wonders of Your mighty love.
