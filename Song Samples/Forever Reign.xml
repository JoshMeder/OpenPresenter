You are good, You are good<br/>When there’s nothing good in me<br/>You are love, You are love<br/>On display for all to see<br/>You are light, You are light<br/>When the darkness closes in<br/>You are hope, You are hope<br/>You have covered all my sin

<verse name="v2">
<lines>
You are peace, You are peace<br/>When my fear is crippling<br/>You are true, You are true<br/>Even in my wandering<br/>You are joy, You are joy<br/>You’re the reason that I sing<br/>You are life, You are life<br/>In You death has lost its sting

<verse name="v3">

I’m running to Your arms<br/>I’m running to Your arms<br/>The riches of Your love<br/>Will always be enough<br/>Nothing compares<br/>To Your embrace<br/>Light of the world<br/>Forever reign

<verse name="v4">
<lines>
You are more, You are more<br/>Than my words will ever say<br/>You are Lord, You are Lord<br/>All creation will proclaim<br/>You are here, You are here<br/>In Your presence I’m made whole<br/>You are God, You are God<br/>Of all else I’m letting go
